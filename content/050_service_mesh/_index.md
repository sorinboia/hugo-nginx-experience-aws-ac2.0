We are pleased to introduce a development release of NGINX Service Mesh (NSM), a fully integrated lightweight service mesh that leverages a data plane powered by NGINX Plus to manage container traffic in Kubernetes environments.  
NSM secures applications in a zero‑trust environment by seamlessly applying encryption and authentication to container traffic. It delivers observability and insights into transactions to help organizations deploy and troubleshoot problems quickly and accurately. It also provides fine‑grained traffic control, enabling DevOps teams to deploy and optimize application components while empowering Dev teams to build and easily connect their distributed applications.
