1. Open the [Cloud9 console](https://eu-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home), and click on **Open IDE**.
   This will open a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and a terminal. We will be using it for the rest of the workshop.
   
{{% notice warning %}}
Ad blockers, javascript disablers, and tracking blockers should be disabled for the cloud9 domain, or connecting to the workspace might be impacted. Cloud9 requires third-party-cookies. You can whitelist the specific domains.

2. Run the following command to install all the software tools required to run the workshop:

```
labs/eks/install.sh

The output of the script should show:
{{< output >}}
kubectl in path
jq in path
envsubst in path
aws in path
aws-iam-authenticator in path
terraform in path
{{< /output >}}

&nbsp;&nbsp;

3. Disable temporary credentials:
- In the Cloud9 IDE click the gear icon (in top right corner), or click to open a new tab and choose "Open Preferences"
- Select **AWS SETTINGS**

4. Validate the IAM role:
 
Use the [GetCallerIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-caller-identity.html) CLI command to validate that the Cloud9 IDE is using the correct IAM role.

```
aws sts get-caller-identity --query Arn | grep eksworkshop-admin -q && echo "IAM role valid" || echo "IAM role NOT valid"
```

If the IAM role is not valid, <span style="color: red;">**DO NOT PROCEED**</span>. Go back and confirm the steps on this page.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

5. Clone the Workshop Repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/sorinboia/nginx-experience-aws
cd nginx-experience-aws/
```
