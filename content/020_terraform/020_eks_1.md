While you wait, you can review the [Introduction section of the AWS EKS Workshop](https://eksworkshop.com/010_introduction/) to learn about Kubernetes and Amazon EKS basics.

### Managed control plane
Amazon EKS provides a scalable and highly-available control plane that runs across multiple AWS availability zones. The Amazon EKS service automatically manages the availability and scalability of the Kubernetes API servers and the etcd persistence layer for each cluster. Amazon EKS runs the Kubernetes control plane across three Availability Zones in order to ensure high availability, and it automatically detects and replaces unhealthy masters.

### Managed worker nodes
Amazon EKS lets you create, update, or terminate worker nodes for your cluster with a single command. Managed node groups run nodes using the latest EKS-optimized AMIs in your AWS account while updates and terminations gracefully drain nodes to ensure your applications stay available.
