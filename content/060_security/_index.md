The Nginx App Protect will allow to improve the application security posture, especially against [OWASP Top 10 attacks](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).  
The Nginx App Protect is deployed in the ingress resource therefor is able to see all traffic coming to our application from the outside world.  
We'll be able to bring security closer to the application and the development cycle and integrate it into CI/CD pipelines.
This will allow to minimize false positives, since the web application firewall policy becomes a part of the application and is always tested as such.
