1. Create an environment
##### "N" -> "Services" -> "Environments" -> "Create Environment"  
In all the fields, enter the following value: ```prod```.

Click on "View API Request".  
All the configuration on the Nginx Controller can be easlly automated with external orchestration systems, this view can help you in understanding how to generate the configuration API calls.  

The output will look like this:
{{< output >}}
{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "prod",
    "displayName": "prod",
    "description": "prod",
    "tags": [
      "prod"
    ]
  },
  "desiredState": {}
}
{{< /output >}}

Click "Submit".

2. Create the Certificate:

> Name: ```server-cert```   
> Environment: ```prod ```

So far we have created an environment, uploaded the certificate/key that we will use for our HTTPS connection, created a gateway which represents our entry point into the API gateway and last defined a new application object.
