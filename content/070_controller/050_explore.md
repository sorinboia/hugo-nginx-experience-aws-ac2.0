2. Inspect the published APIs
##### Click "Routing"

You can observe the "arcadia-stocks" component. This is the only API we have published and is in charge of responding with current crypto currencies prices.  
This API is also accessed by the browser application and is not limited.  
We have published this API for thinrd party consumers and we have added authentication and rate limiting.
